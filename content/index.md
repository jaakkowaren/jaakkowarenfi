My name is Jaakko Warén and this is where I publish some of my notes. Right now I´m only using this to practice how I can publish my Obsidian notes as a webpage.

This page is built using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). And I found [this instruction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s6DT1yN4dw&t) by Nicole van der Hoeven be extremely useful.
